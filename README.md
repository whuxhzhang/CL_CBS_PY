# CL-CBS

## Overview

**Car-Like Conflict-Based Search (CL-CBS)** is an efficient and complete solver of Multi-Agent Path Finding for Car-like Robots problem. It applies a body conflict tree to address collisions considering the shape of agents. It also includes a new algorithm Spatiotemporal Hybrid-State A* as the single-agent path planner to generate path satisfying both kinematic and spatiotemporal constraints.

## Source Code
### Requirement
```bash
sudo apt-get install g++ cmake libboost-program-options-dev libyaml-cpp-dev \
clang-tidy clang-format python3-matplotlib libompl-dev libeigen3-dev
```
> Note: Please make sure your `matplotlib` version is above `2.0`, otherwise it may show weird image while visualization. You can upgrade it by `pip3 install -U matplotlib`.


### Build
```bash
mkdir build 
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  ..
make -j8
```

* `make`: Build CL-CBS code
* `make docs`: Build doxygen documentation
* `make clang-format`: Re-format all source files
* `make all`: Build all three targets above


### Run example instances
```bash
# make sure your are in build folder
# default 10 agent in a batch
./CL-CBS -i ../benchmark/map100by100/agents20/obstacle/map_100by100_obst50_agents20_ex13.yaml -o output.yaml 
# or compute 20 agents in a whole batch
./CL-CBS -i ../benchmark/map100by100/agents20/obstacle/map_100by100_obst50_agents20_ex13.yaml -o output.yaml -b 20 
```

### Visualize Results
```bash
# make sure your are in build folder
python3 ../src/visualize.py -m  ../benchmark/map100by100/agents20/obstacle/map_100by100_obst50_agents20_ex13.yaml  -s output.yaml
```

### Agent Configuration
The agent configurations, including the size, the kinematic constraints, and penalty functions can be changed in `src/config.yaml`.

## Benchmark

Benchmark for evaluating CL-MAPF problem are available in `benchmark` folder. It contains 3000 unique instances with different map size and agents number.

The folder are arranged like follows, each mapset contains 60 instances:

```
benchmark
├── map100by100
│   ├── agents10
│   │   ├── empty
│   │   └── obstacle
│   ...
├── map300by300
│   ├── agents10
│   │   ├── empty
│   │   └── obstacle
│   ...
└── map50by50
    ├── agents10
    │   ├── empty
    │   └── obstacle
    ...
```

The instance are in `yaml` format.

A typical result from benchmark acts like below:
